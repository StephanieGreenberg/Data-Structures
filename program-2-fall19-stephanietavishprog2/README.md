## SUMMARY

Team Members: Stephanie Greenberg

Program takes in and parses a file containing planet data. Uses a scanner to refine probability of life on each planet, which gets us closer to finding out if there is life on that planet. Scanner uses a priority queue implemented with a templated heap to store planets.

### Test 1
* Testing: getval(int i) in scanner. Planet temp should equal the first value on test2.dat file. 
* Expected Result: Planet("Kepler-1049b",0.0)

### Test 2
* Testing: Heap can handle negative values. Priority value will be correctly determined and comparisons will be handled correctly.
* Expected Result: Heap with priority value of -1
